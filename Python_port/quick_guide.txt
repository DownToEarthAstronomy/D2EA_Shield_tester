This will determine the name of the log file and tab in the interface.
Because this affects the file only letters, numbers, and some symbols are
permitted.

# Defender
Set up your ship here by selecting what to use, the class of your shield
generator and the number of boosters.
Put in numbers for shield cell banks and guardian shield reinforcements if
you want to take those into consideration.

If you don't have access to prismatic shields or just don't want to include
them in the tests, uncheck it.

# Attacker
Set up incoming DPS. Don't worry if you don't know exact values.
Experiment a bit and look up some values on Coriolis.

## Damage effectiveness
This is percentage of time you'll be taking fire. Shields can only recharge,
when you are not being shot. A low damage effectiveness will give your shields
more time to recharge.

# Misc
This section describes some settings that affect performance of the calculations.

## Use short list
Don't use explosive resistance focused boosters to decrease number of combinations

## CPU cores to use
Using more cores can speed up the program by a considerable amount.

## Preliminary filtering of shield generators
Check this when you want the program to search for the best possible shield
generators before running the time intensive calculations. This can have a
huge impact on runtime with the disadvantage of not always finding the best
possible loadout.

# Buttons
Start or cancel calculations and when you have a result, you can open it the
result of the current selected tab on Coriolis.
